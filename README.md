# HanserLoader
Like downloading individual chapter PDFs from Hanser e-Library? Me neither. 

This is a simple tool to load, bind and export books automatically.

It is by no means a stable or well structured program, use at your own risk.

Caution: Excessive use may lead to your ip being blocked by Hanser for a undetermined amount of time, proceed with caution!

## Usage
Download *.exe for a ready to run solution, check this repo out if you want to have a little more control.

Startup and book selection is done via command line, call with `-h for usage`.
